Description: RateRate provides functions to evaluate the two-rate 
    model as described by Maurice Smith et al. (2006), as well as
    an error-function that can be used for fitting the model and a 
    function that first does a grid search, picks the best 5 fits and
    optimizes those, minimizing square errors.
