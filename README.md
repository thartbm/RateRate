# RateRate

Some R functions to fit Maurice Smith's two-rate model of motor learning. See Smith et al. (2006) for details on the model (DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040179)

## Installing the package in R

First do: install.packages('devtools','Rcpp')

Then install with: devtools::install_github("thartbm/RateRate")

If you don't have it yet, this will also ask you to install Rtools, and then you might have to run the command again.
